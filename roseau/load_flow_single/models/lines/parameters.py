        Args:
            id:
                A unique ID of the line parameters, typically its canonical name.

            z_line:
                 The Z matrix of the line (Ohm/km).

            y_shunt:
                The Y matrix of the line (Siemens/km). This field is optional if the line has no shunt part.

            max_current:
                The maximum current loading of the line (A). The maximum current is optional, it is
                not used in the load flow but can be used to check for overloading.
                See also :meth:`Line.res_violated <roseau.load_flow.Line.res_violated>`.

            line_type:
                The type of the line (overhead, underground, twisted). The line type is optional,
                it is informative only and is not used in the load flow. This field gets
                automatically filled when the line parameters are created from a geometric model or
                from the catalogue.

            conductor_type:
                The type of the conductor material (Aluminum, Copper, ...). The conductor type is
                optional, it is informative only and is not used in the load flow. This field gets
                automatically filled when the line parameters are created from a geometric model or
                from the catalogue.

            insulator_type:
                The type of the cable insulator (PVC, XLPE, ...). The insulator type is optional,
                it is informative only and is not used in the load flow. This field gets
                automatically filled when the line parameters are created from a geometric model or
                from the catalogue.
